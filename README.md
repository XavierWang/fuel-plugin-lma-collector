The StackLight Collector Plugin for Fuel
========================================

The StackLight Collector Plugin is used to install and
configure several software components that are used to
collect and process all the data that we think is relevant
to provide deep operational insights about your OpenStack environment.
These finely integrated components are collectively referred to as
the StackLight Collector (or just the Collector).

The Collecor is a key component of the so-called Logging,
Monitoring and Alerting (LMA) toolchain of Mirantis OpenStack.

Please start with the [StackLight Collector Plugin Overview](
http://fuel-plugin-lma-collector.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html)
